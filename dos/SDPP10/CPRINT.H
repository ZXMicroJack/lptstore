/*   This file contains simple ASCII output routines.  These are used   */
/* by the device driver for debugging, and to issue informational */
/* messages (e.g. while loading).  In general the C run time library    */
/* functions probably aren't safe for use withing the context of a   */
/* device driver and should be avoided.               */
/*                         */
/*   All these routines do their output thru the routine outchr, which  */
/* is defined in DRIVER.ASM.  It calls the BIOS INT 10 "dumb TTY" */
/* output function directly and does not use MSDOS at all.     */
